Deuteronomy 31:12, NIV","golden_text_verse":"","body":"<p>Renowned Bible scholar, F. F. Bruce once noted that 'The Bible was never intended to be a book for scholars and specialists only. From the very beginning it was intended to be everybody's book, and that is what it continues to be.' Bruce's assertion finds a parallel in Moses' instruction to the Israelites as seen in today's reading. To overcome the tendency to forget His instructions, God made provisions for the laws to be read to His people often, especially during festivals. Moses instructed them that no one living in the town, irrespective of their age or status, should be exempted from listening to the reading of the law at the Festival of Booths. Listening to the words of the law will aid their learning to fear the LORD and help them to follow carefully all the words therein.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a New Year, and it is imperative to ask yourself, 'Did I spend enough time reading the Bible last year? What plans do I have to improve my consumption of God's words this year?' God emphasised to Joshua the importance of the law for a successful living: 'Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful' (Joshua 1:8). A famous preacher once said, 'The Bible is God's chart for you to steer by, to keep you from the bottom of the sea, and to show you where the harbor is, and how to reach it without running on rocks or bars.' As you journey through 2020, choose to become addicted to reading the Word of God. Let your words be seasoned with the Word; let your thoughts be saturated with it, and let your actions portray it. Your victory is sure this year as you dwell in the Word.

The Bible records about his <br\/>\r\ndaily meal \u2013 that he never ran out of stock throughout <br\/>\r\nhis lifetime (1 Kings 4:22-24). Solomon was a great <br\/>\r\nking. Yet Jesus stated that the glory of King Solomon is nothing compared to the glory God bestows on the lilies of the ?eld.<br\/>\r\nThe greatness of King Solomon is a poor re?ection of the majestic greatness <br\/>\r\nof God. God's glory and greatness is not to be compared with anything. In saying <br\/>\r\nthis, Jesus stated the futility of worry and anxiety and encourages us to rely on <br\/>\r\nGod who does not fail. God is the Source of all glory and splendour for He, <br\/>\r\nHimself is glorious. From His glorious riches, He will daily provide all your <br\/>\r\nneeds.God never runs out of stock. Psalm 50:9-10 explicitly <br\/>\r\nsays  that  God  owns  all.  Unlike  Solomon  who  only <br\/>\r\npossessed  things  within  his  domain,  God's  domain  is <br\/>\r\neverywhere.

Fear  and  faith  are  opposites  and  when  it <br\/>\r\ncomes to life's issues, believers cannot a?ord to live <br\/>\r\nlike the impala who would choose to remain con?ned <br\/>\r\ndue to fear. God gave Habakkuk a vision and told him <br\/>\r\nthat it would surely come to pass, but warned him to <br\/>\r\nkeep faith and wait because its ful?lment would be at a <br\/>\r\nfuture  date  (v.  3).  God  told  him  to  write  the  vision down so that by constantly reading it, he and others would remain ready and <br\/>\r\nexpectant (v. 2). God revealed to Habakkuk that only a proud person would reject <br\/>\r\nGod's wisdom, but a righteous person will triumph by his faith (v. 4).<br\/>\r\nFaith is the key operating principle of the New Testament. In 3 BC, a Jewish <br\/>\r\nrabbi  called  Simla  noted  that  Moses  gave  365  prohibitions  and  248  positive <br\/>\r\ncommands; David reduced them to eleven commands in Psalm 15; Isaiah made <br\/>\r\nthem six (Isaiah 33:13, 15). Micah bound them into three (6:8); and Habakkuk <br\/>\r\nreduced them all to this one great statement: 'The righteous shall live by faith.' <br\/>\r\nFaith  shifts  focus  from  ourselves  to  God.  By  it,  the <br\/>\r\nrighteous  prospers  in  business,  marriage,  and  life <br\/>\r\ngenerally. Without faith, we are nothing, have nothing, <br\/>\r\nand  achieve  nothing.  In  addition,  'faith'  here  means <br\/>\r\n'faithfulness' (staying true to God). We need faith to <br\/>\r\nful?l God's vision for our lives and faithfulness to keep <br\/>\r\nour relationship with Him.

Martin argues that the fear of <br\/>\r\nGod  is  an  important  theme  in  the  Bible,  yet  many <br\/>\r\nChristians  today  overlook  it  or  treat  it  carelessly. <br\/>\r\nLooking through the theme of fear in both Old and <br\/>\r\nNew  Testament,  author  Martin  admonishes  today's <br\/>\r\nbelievers to maintain and increase their fear of God. <br\/>\r\nMartin's admonition is rooted in the Bible, as we <br\/>\r\nsee  in  today's  psalm,  where  a  father  invites  his <br\/>\r\nchildren to listen to him as he would teach them the <br\/>\r\nfear of God. One of the ways to learn the fear of God is to keep our tongues from evil and our lips from speaking lies (v. 13). Turning <br\/>\r\naway from evil, doing good, seeking and pursuing peace are also indices of the <br\/>\r\nfear of God in our hearts (v. 14). While the Lord pays attention to those who fear <br\/>\r\nHim and hears their cry, His face is against those who do evil to cut o? their <br\/>\r\nmemory from the heart (vv. 15-16).<br\/>\r\nAnxiety  and  fear,  experts  say,  are  on  top  of  the  list  of  today's  human <br\/>\r\nproblems. Many of us live in secret fear of something. The fear of shame, pain, <br\/>\r\ndanger, death or loss of investments makes many cringe. But why do we fear <br\/>\r\nthese things so much and fear God less? That perhaps is the undoing of today's <br\/>\r\nsociety, and may be the reason we are where we ?nd <br\/>\r\nourselves.<br\/>\r\nIn an age where the fear of God is relegated to the <br\/>\r\nbackground and other things take the centre stage, we <br\/>\r\nmust learn to fear God and be models of the fear of God <br\/>\r\nto those we come across every day.

A time came that his family <br\/>\r\nhad to move to another part of the city. The <br\/>\r\nlittle  boy  insisted  that  though  the  church  is  quite  a <br\/>\r\ndistance  away,  he  would  not  stop  attending  the <br\/>\r\nSunday  school.  When  someone  asked  him,  'why <br\/>\r\nwould you prefer going to a far distance when there <br\/>\r\nare  plenty  of  churches  near  your  home?'  His  reply <br\/>\r\nwas, 'They may be as good for others, but not for me.' <br\/>\r\n'Why not?', the person queried further. 'Because they <br\/>\r\nlove me over there,' he replied. <br\/>\r\nJohn encouraged the believers to walk in love, in obedience to God's commands. He expressed his joy at those who walk in the <br\/>\r\ntruth; the truth is that believers should walk in love. The command for believers to <br\/>\r\nwalk in love and harmony becomes important because many deceivers have gone <br\/>\r\nout into the world (v. 7). In love, believers are to be on their watch for these <br\/>\r\ndeceivers and antichrists who do not remain in the teachings of Christ (v. 9).<br\/>\r\nOur  walk  signi?es  our  way  of  life  and  for  us  to  remain  in  the  truth  and <br\/>\r\nteachings  of  Jesus  Christ,  love  must  be  our  watchword  and  way  of  life. The <br\/>\r\ncommand to love is not a new one, but it is one we must continue to give ourselves <br\/>\r\nto so we can together stand as God's children against the whims of the enemy. To <br\/>\r\nwalk together in love is wisdom and living otherwise is <br\/>\r\nunwise.  Consider  your  own  life.  Are  you  living  in <br\/>\r\nobedience to the command to love?

Corban is a Hebrew\/Aramaic word meaning <br\/>\r\n'o?ering.' By invoking Corban they sidestepped the <br\/>\r\n?fth commandment that demands that children should <br\/>\r\nhonour  their  parents.

Christ  is <br\/>\r\ndescribed  as  the  power  and  wisdom  of  God  (1 <br\/>\r\nCorinthians 1:24). Hence, to be truly wise, you need to <br\/>\r\nconnect with Jesus.

This  explains  why  Apostle  James  exhorted  the  Jewish <br\/>\r\nChristians of his days, who were being persecuted for their faith in Christ, not to <br\/>\r\nlose heart but hold on to God in faith through perseverance. They were also <br\/>\r\nencouraged to seek the face of God for wisdom.<br\/>\r\nIt is obvious that Christians live in a very hostile environment occasioned by <br\/>\r\ntrials and temptations against their faith in Christ Jesus. <br\/>\r\nWe must, however, remain resolute and stay focused on <br\/>\r\nour Lord, as we seek His face for wisdom without any <br\/>\r\ndoubt in our hearts. We must never put our trust in riches <br\/>\r\nbecause they will soon fade away.

To a very large<br\/>\r\nextent, this is a practical way of explaining what it<br\/>\r\nreally means to fear the Lord. Many people, Christians<br\/>\r\ninclusive, claim to fear the Lord yet care less about their<br\/>\r\nthoughts, speech, actions, and attitudes with regards to<br\/>\r\nthe commands of the Lord. This is not in tandem with<br\/>\r\nwhat it means to fear the Lord.<br\/>\r\nAbraham demonstrated what it means to fear the Lord when he was tested by the Lord to sacri?ce his covenant son, Isaac, as a burnt<br\/>\r\no?ering.

He did not'<br\/>\r\npretend in his response to God to o?er Isaac as a burnt<br\/>\r\no?ering. He really meant it. He clearly showed to us that<br\/>\r\nfearing God means obeying God's command absolutely.<br\/>\r\nGod saw the sincerity of Abraham and blessed him.<br\/>\r\nThe Lord rescued Isaac, and provided a ram as a substitute<br\/>\r\nfor the burnt sacri?ce. The blessings the Lord pronounced<br\/>\r\non  Abraham  even  extended  to  his  descendants.

There are lots of lessons to be <br\/>\r\nlearnt from these two sayings. <br\/>\r\nIn today's text, our Saviour and Lord Jesus Christ, <br\/>\r\nsays we must not swear at all whether by things in <br\/>\r\nheaven or by things on earth, no matter the point we <br\/>\r\nare trying to make. He further stated that our 'Yes' <br\/>\r\nshould simply be 'Yes' and our 'No' should simply <br\/>\r\nbe 'No', because anything beyond this comes from <br\/>\r\nthe evil one. Little wonder the wise man noted that 'when words are many, sin is not absent, but he who holds his tongue is wise.' <br\/>\r\n(Proverbs 10:19) What we need is not plenty words to express our opinions or <br\/>\r\nhow we feel about situations. What we need is clarity in our presentation of the <br\/>\r\nmatter. This is wisdom. We do not need to impress anyone with many words. We <br\/>\r\nonly need to state the case as it is. This will help us to escape the temptation of <br\/>\r\nfalling into sins. <br\/>\r\nHowever, the summary of these lessons is simply that we need to watch what <br\/>\r\nwe say and how we say such.

He went the extra mile to Dothan when he <br\/>\r\ncould not find them at Shechem. <br\/>\r\nWhen Jacob called Joseph to pursue his brothers, Joseph's response was a <br\/>\r\nnoble 'Here am I' (v. 13). The answer indicated Joseph's ready submission to the <br\/>\r\ncommands of his father. He was a good servant, for <br\/>\r\nservice begins with submission to the master. Christian <br\/>\r\nservice  begins  with  submission  to  Christ. Therefore, <br\/>\r\nmany who complain of not being used in service have <br\/>\r\nonly their lack of submission to blame.

Many <br\/>\r\ntimes we sin and instead of being punished for our sins, <br\/>\r\nGod takes our place, cleanses us and we soon forget <br\/>\r\nbecause  God  is  merciful  to  forgive. This  is  probably <br\/>\r\nwhy David wrote this psalm in appreciation of God's <br\/>\r\ngracious love and mercy. He praised God for who He is, and thanked Him for what He had done. He recounted the grace of God over Israel; <br\/>\r\nHe healed their diseases and forgave them their sins (v. 3). He did to them what they <br\/>\r\ndid not merit. They enjoyed His mercy, divine provision and renewal of strength day <br\/>\r\nafter day (vv. 4-5). He showered His love towards them while they were in Egypt and <br\/>\r\nin the wilderness, He rebuked them when they erred and afterwards showed them <br\/>\r\nmercy  (vv.  6-8).  David  declared  that  God's  mercy  is <br\/>\r\nunimaginable and has no limitation (vv. 11-14). <br\/>\r\nGod's  demonstration  of  love  towards  us  is <br\/>\r\nunquantifiable. This is the reason why love is the basis of <br\/>\r\nthe Christian life. Do you take time to think about God's <br\/>\r\nlove for you and members of your family or you love to <br\/>\r\ncomplain over every little discomfort forgetting the times <br\/>\r\nof pleasant victories and blessings? Being a holy God, He <br\/>\r\ndid get angry at our sin, but in His compassion, He forgave <br\/>\r\nthem. The punishment that we deserve was given to Jesus. <br\/>\r\nLike David, why don't you sing songs of praise to him for <br\/>\r\nHis mercy and grace! <\/p>\r\n","wisdom":"<p>y <strong>Wisdom<\/strong>:  I t  i s <br\/>\r\nbecause  of  God's <br\/>\r\nmercy  that  we  are <br\/>\r\nnot consumed.<br\/>\r\ny <strong>Food for thought<\/strong>: <br\/>\r\nBe  merciful  as  the <br\/>\r\nLord is merciful to <br\/>\r\nyou.<br\/>\r\ny <strong>Follow-up Action<\/strong>: <br\/>\r\nReconcile  with  the <br\/>\r\npeople  that  you <br\/>\r\nregard as your <br\/>\r\nenemies.<br\/>\r\ny <strong>Prayer<\/strong>:  Lord,  let <br\/>\r\nYour  righteousness <br\/>\r\nlift  me  up  at  the <br\/>\r\ntime of my <br\/>\r\ndepression.<\/p>\r\n","prayer_for_ministers":"Mark  Godwin,  Obazu-Mbieri;  Alao  Israel  Folagboye, Aramoko; Ayanlere Richard Ayanyemi, Mowe  Ogun.","prayer":"I come against the spirit of double-mindedness and unfaithfulness in my life in Jesus' name."},{"id":280,"devotional_date":"October       6 Tuesday","hymn":"BH 180: Thy Word Is  a Lamp to My Feet","rbt":" Ma hew 12-13","topic":"RESPONDING TO UNWANTED DEMAND","text":"Matthew 5:38-42","golden_text":"But I tell you, do not resist an evil person, if someone  strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

Having listened to Jesus' answers to the questions that people<br\/>\r\nasked, and perceiving that He answered well, this scribe sought to know which<br\/>\r\ncommandment is the most important of all.

The  passage  for  our  consideration  today  is  about  the  ten  lepers.  In  His <br\/>\r\ncharacteristic manner, Jesus travelled from one place to the other doing good. At <br\/>\r\nthis time, He was along the border between Samaria and Galilee (v. 11). The <br\/>\r\nlepers were begging for mercy. God in His mercy visited them. Meeting Jesus <br\/>\r\nand getting healed was meeting with hope again, an opportunity to reunite with <br\/>\r\nloved ones, and live life to the fullest. The one leper, a foreigner, who came back <br\/>\r\nto  Jesus,  unlike  the  other  nine,  would  not  take  all  of  these  for  granted.

When  Jesus<br\/>\r\nreached Samaria, He stopped at a place called Sychar<br\/>\r\nto take His rest by Jacob's well, having walked a long<br\/>\r\ndistance. A woman who went to draw water met Him<br\/>\r\nby the well. The woman was a Samaritan, a member of<br\/>\r\nthe hated mixed race.

However, to justify <br\/>\r\nhimself, he asked Jesus, 'Who is my neighbour?' (v. <br\/>\r\n29) To answer his question, Jesus gave a parable about <br\/>\r\na  certain  man  who  was  attacked  and  stripped  by <br\/>\r\nthieves  on  the  road  from  Jerusalem  to  Jericho. The  incidence showed three categories of personalities who had the same opportunity <br\/>\r\nto prove the law of Moses which had been known to them. The first is a priest who <br\/>\r\nonly looked at the wounded man as a problem to avoid. The next is a Levite who <br\/>\r\nalso looked at him with curiosity but not as one to be helped. But when the third <br\/>\r\nperson who happens to be a Samaritan saw him, he had compassion on him and <br\/>\r\ntreated him as a person to love. There are two basic things to learn from the <br\/>\r\npassage: One, lack of love is often easy to justify, even though it is never right. <br\/>\r\nTwo, love means acting to meet another person's need.

By all human reasoning, Joseph's <br\/>\r\nbrothers had presented themselves as his enemies and <br\/>\r\nshould be treated as such. Out of envy and bitterness, they sold him to Egypt, and told their father that he was dead. They would never <br\/>\r\nhave expected to see him, again, let alone seeing him as a man that God has <br\/>\r\nblessed so much. <br\/>\r\nIn spite of all these, Joseph chose to treat them as friends and family by <br\/>\r\nwelcoming them to his home. He showed kind gesture to his brothers without <br\/>\r\nconsidering the weight of the evil they have done to him. His stewards provided <br\/>\r\nwater for his brothers to wash their feet before coming to dine with Joseph.<br\/>\r\nJoseph's gesture to his brothers provides us an example of biblical hospitality. <br\/>\r\nJesus admonished us to 'love your enemies and pray for those who persecute <br\/>\r\nyou, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on <br\/>\r\nthe evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous <br\/>\r\nand the unrighteous....' (Matthew 5:44-45) The Lord <br\/>\r\nwants us to extend the hand of  hospitality to those we <br\/>\r\nconsider enemy; those who hate us and those we would <br\/>\r\nrather not be nice to. There should be no one outside the <br\/>\r\nreach of your hospitality. <\/p>\r\n","wisdom":"<p>y <strong>Wisdom<\/strong>:  Helping <br\/>\r\no t h e r s   m e a n s <br\/>\r\ns e r v i n g  o t h e r s <br\/>\r\nwhere God put us. <br\/>\r\ny <strong>Food for Thought<\/strong>: <br\/>\r\nDo  I  show  love  to <br\/>\r\nthose who hate me?<br\/>\r\ny <strong>Follow-up Action<\/strong>: <br\/>\r\nExtend  hospitality <br\/>\r\nto  someone  you'll <br\/>\r\nrather not.<br\/>\r\ny <strong>Prayer<\/strong>: Lord, help <br\/>\r\nme  to  love  as  you <br\/>\r\nwant me to.<\/p>\r\n","prayer_for_ministers":"Olojede  S.O.,  Ogbomoso;  Jooda  Isaac,  Eliogbolo; Omotara E.O., Ikirun","prayer":"I decree that anywhere my names are mentioned in the coven of witches  and wizards, the ?re of God shall answer them in Jesus' name."},{"id":302,"devotional_date":"October      28  Wednesday","hymn":"BH 426: O Master, Let  Me Walk with Thee","rbt":" Luke 16-18","topic":"DIFFERENT PEOPLE, BUT SAME LORD","text":"Ephesians 4:3-9","golden_text":"There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called  to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith,  one baptism.

But experience has shown many times that<br\/>\r\nthe power of self is limited, and that except we trust in a<br\/>\r\npower greater than self, we are likely to self-destruct.<br\/>\r\nPeter trusted in the power of self. His self confidence<br\/>\r\nwas great and he thought there was nothing he would<br\/>\r\nnot be able to attain once he trusted in himself. But<br\/>\r\nwhen he found himself in real situations that seemed to<br\/>\r\ndwarf his self power, he failed woefully. When Jesus predicted Peter's denial of Him, Peter would not believe it. He <br\/>\r\nwas so con?dent of himself that he vowed to lay down his life for Jesus. He said: <br\/>\r\n'Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death' (Luke 22:33). Kent <br\/>\r\nHughes likened Peter's self confidence to the kind of presumption we see in a <br\/>\r\nnaturally gifted athlete who finds it hard to listen to the coach's advice because he <br\/>\r\nfeels he does not need it.

No one is beyond falling. We all face the temptation<br\/>\r\nto deny Jesus everyday, and we will always have to choose to either identify with Jesus or deny ever knowing Him. But then, identifying<br\/>\r\nwith Jesus, especially when it seems dificult, cannot be<br\/>\r\ndone with human strength. That is why we need to daily<br\/>\r\npray for strength not to deny Him, even when it seems<br\/>\r\ndi?cult.

Jesus Christ is the Light of the world. <br\/>\r\nWhat this implies is that this world is full of darkness. <br\/>\r\nThe darkness that is being referred to here is not the <br\/>\r\ndarkness  without  the  physical  light,  rather  it  is  a darkness  of  personality  that  manifests  through  the  behaviours  of  people. <br\/>\r\nUnfortunately, all humanity was born into the world through this personality <br\/>\r\ncalled darkness. But the coming of the Lord Jesus brought light to humanity and <br\/>\r\nput an end to the reign of darkness since the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. <br\/>\r\nIn the passage, Jesus summarises the subject of salvation and condemnation. <br\/>\r\nThe Father gave His Son who in turn gave His life to save sinners.

In <br\/>\r\ntoday's  passage,  James  deals  with  the  problem  of <br\/>\r\npartiality or favouritism in the church. He described <br\/>\r\nthe  act  as  unjust  and  a  sin  before  God.  One <br\/>\r\ncommentator notes that 'in its early days the church <br\/>\r\nwas predominantly poor and humble; and therefore if <br\/>\r\na rich man was converted, and come to the Christian <br\/>\r\nfellowship,  there  must  have  been  a  very  real <br\/>\r\ntemptation  to  a  fuss  of  him,  and  to  treat  him  as  a special trophy for Christ.'

The Bible does <br\/>\r\nnot approve this kind of practice.<br\/>\r\nJames provides at least five reasons why partiality is<br\/>\r\nunbiblical: 1. It is inconsistent with God's command: 'show<br\/>\r\nnot partiality' (v.1). 2. It is inconsistent with our faith in<br\/>\r\nChrist: 'my brothers' (v. 1). 3. It is inconsistent with the<br\/>\r\ngospel: 'faith in our Lord Jesus Christ' (v. 1). 4. It is<br\/>\r\ninconsistent with God's character: 'has not God chosen<br\/>\r\nthose who poor in the world' (v. 5). 5.

People trace their<br\/>\r\nfamily history for various reasons: either to validate a<br\/>\r\nfamily story, to trace a family inheritance, to get a proof<br\/>\r\nof paternity or to document family history. Achieving<br\/>\r\nthis often involves drawing a family tree that provides<br\/>\r\nthe link between one generation and another.<br\/>\r\nThe book of Matthew also presents a family tree <br\/>\r\nwith a long list of names. The opening verse states the <br\/>\r\nimportance of the long list: 'Arecord of the genealogy <br\/>\r\nof  Jesus  Christ,  the  son  of  David,  the  son  of Abraham.' (v.1). There are so many names in the genealogy but the beginning <br\/>\r\nand end of the tree shows that all connect to Christ from Abraham through David.<br\/>\r\nThe genealogy of Jesus Christ has much to tell us. That Jesus came from the <br\/>\r\ntree  of Abraham  through  David  is  a  proof  of  God's  faithfulness  in  ful?lling <br\/>\r\npromises that He makes. God promised to bless the nations of the world through <br\/>\r\nAbraham. And  to  David,  He  promised  an  everlasting  dynasty.  Though  these <br\/>\r\npromises were made long before the birth of Christ; and it is possible that people <br\/>\r\nmay no longer remember them, Matthew brings it to the fore again that God <br\/>\r\nful?ls promises, and that no word of His will ever fall to the ground without being <br\/>\r\nful?lled. Fourteen generations from Abraham to David, <br\/>\r\nfourteen  from  David  to  the  Babylonian  exile,  and <br\/>\r\nanother fourteen generations from then to Christ were <br\/>\r\nvery long. Still, they could not stop the plan of God to <br\/>\r\nraise a Saviour and Deliverer for the whole human race.<br\/>\r\nIf you have made Christ your Lord, you can trace <br\/>\r\nyour generation from Christ, and claim all that accrue to <br\/>\r\nthose who are in Christ. Also, you can count on God, <br\/>\r\nabsolutely. You can rest on His unchanging promises, <br\/>\r\neven in changing circumstances.

He  needed  the  believers  to  note  the <br\/>\r\nsuperiority and the supremacy of Christ over angels. That is why he needed to <br\/>\r\ncompare angels and Christ. The Christ they have come to is the One that angels <br\/>\r\nhave been commanded to worship (v. 6). Though angels are ministering spirits to <br\/>\r\nbelievers, they are subject to the reign of Christ the King whose throne is eternal. <br\/>\r\nThe  scepter  of  His  kingdom  is  a  scepter  of  justice  and  righteousness.

Some in our time have honoured Jesus as the <br\/>\r\ngreatest teacher who ever lived. Some have seen him <br\/>\r\nas a great prophet. However, the author of Hebrews <br\/>\r\npresents  Him  as  much  more  than  that.  He  reveals Jesus to us as the Father's own Son. The Son in our passage is used in the sense of <br\/>\r\nJesus the Son corresponding exactly to the Father and serving as His personal <br\/>\r\nspokesman. <br\/>\r\nHow is Jesus the Son?

Jesus is: Heir, Co-creator and agent of creation, the radiance of <br\/>\r\ndivine glory, the exact representation of God's being, the Sustainer and Preserver <br\/>\r\nof the universe and Co-ruler.

Mary was a lady from the royal family. she was a virgin, and she lived in Nazareth, a city of Galilee.

The child <br\/>\r\nshe shall conceive is a holy one, and therefore, He must not share in the common <br\/>\r\ncorruption and pollution of the human nature. Mary was troubled at the angel's <br\/>\r\ngreeting, and even much more at the news of a child who would reign on David's <br\/>\r\nthrone forever. She asked a logical question: how could a virgin conceive a child? <br\/>\r\nThe angel's response attests to the fact that it would become possible only by <br\/>\r\nGod's own doing, by the work of the Holy Spirit. <br\/>\r\nA virgin birth is impossible for anyone in any age, <br\/>\r\nbut  with  God,  there  is  no  restriction  to  the <br\/>\r\naccomplishment of His plans.

One for<br\/>\r\nJesus, one for Moses and one for Elijah.
